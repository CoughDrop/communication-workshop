    # word-level results to show:
    # usage (combined modeling/usage) over time
    # mastery vs. incorporation
    # current mastery/incorporation estimate
    # mastery/incorporation estimate over time
    # literacy usage over time
    
    # user-level results to show:
    # mastered/incorporated words
    # in-progress words
    # interaction points over time
    # books read over time
    
    # ideas:
    # word-level usage tracker, option to manually add usage/modeling events for a word
    # literacy tracker, option to track reading event, record any focus words used during reading
    # maybe literacy tracker should be more generic, activity tracker, with option for literacy-style
    # maybe just a way to track literacy events, books read related to the word/focus
